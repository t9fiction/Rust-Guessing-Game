# Number Guessing Game in Rust

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Rust. The game randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. With each guess, the game provides feedback: "Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!" to guide the player toward the correct answer.
